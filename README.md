# LADB Builds

This repository provides compiled builds for LADB, allowing you to access the app without purchasing it from the Play Store. All credit goes to the original developer of the application. I will continue to support and compile new builds over time.

I do not intend to cause any financial harm to the original developers. If you want to support the project, please consider paying for it.

**Disclaimer:** I am not affiliated with this project in any way. Use at your own risk!

You can find the original project here: [LADB by tytydraco](https://github.com/tytydraco/LADB). All credits to tytydraco for this fantastic app!

If you notice that the builds are not up to date, it's likely because I am unaware of the latest updates. Please feel free to post an issue, and I will update the builds as soon as possible. 

**Note:** For those concerned about safety and security, I assure you that I have no knowledge of Kotlin.
