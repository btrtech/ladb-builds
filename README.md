# ladb-builds
Compiled builds for LADB so that you don't need to pay in Play Store :) <br>
All credits to the developer for this application. I will keep supporting this and compiling newer builds as time goes on. <br>
I AM IN NO WAY RELATED WITH THIS PROJECT! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! <br>
<br>
Here is the original project: https://github.com/tytydraco/LADB <br>
All credits to tytydraco for this amazing app!!!

If you are worried if I didn't update it, then it most probably means that I am not aware of it. You can post an issue and I will update as soon as I can. Updates will be released after a while. I cannot release the updates immediately. <br>
PS: If you are worried about the safety and security I can guarantee you that I only know how to use Android Studio to compile but don't know Kotlin at all!
