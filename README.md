# ladb-builds
Compiled builds for LADB so that you don't need to pay in the Play Store. <br>
All credits to the developer for this application. I will keep supporting this and compiling newer builds as time goes on. <br>
I don't have any intention to cause financial issues to any of the original devs. If you want to support the project I'd recommend you pay.
I AM IN NO WAY RELATED WITH THIS PROJECT! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! <br>

# A big issue with LADB
v2.1 seems to be broken on OneUI 5. Take a look at https://github.com/tytydraco/LADB/issues/96 and https://github.com/tytydraco/LADB/issues/90. v2.0 works for me. I would recommend getting v2.0 if LADB doesn't work for you too: https://github.com/hyperio546/ladb-builds/releases/tag/v2.0. <br><br>
Here is the original project: https://github.com/tytydraco/LADB <br>
All credits to tytydraco for this amazing app!

If you are worried if I didn't update it, then it most probably means that I am not aware of it. You can post an issue and I will update as soon as I can. Updates will be released after a while. I cannot release the updates immediately. <br> <br>
PS: If you are worried about the safety and security I can guarantee you that I don't know Kotlin at all!
